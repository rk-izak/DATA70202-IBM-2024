## Dependencies

To install the required dependencies, create a `venv` and activate it via:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

and run:

```

Be advised that different `venv` instances and `Python3.XX` versions should be used for different Jupyter notebooks found within this repository in relevant folders. For more information visit [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) and `README` in each folder.
